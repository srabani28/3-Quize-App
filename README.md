This Quiz App is an interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app presents users with multiple-choice questions, allowing them to select answers, track their progress, and view their scores in real-time. At the end of the quiz, users receive a final score along with feedback on their performance.

JavaScript is used to dynamically update the questions and handle user interactions without the need for page reloads. The app ensures an engaging user experience with features like question randomization, immediate score updates, and smooth transitions between questions.

CSS is employed to create a clean, responsive design, making the app compatible across different devices, including mobile phones and desktops. This project showcases front-end skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interaction management.

Ideal for learning or demonstrating JavaScript concepts, this app is a great tool for both developers and users looking for a fun, educational experience.
